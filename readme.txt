Add admin-specific labels to your WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types to make managing your content easier.

== Description ==

Often times the title of a piece of content is meant to grab readers attention or lead them into the introductory paragraph of the content. For example, your contact page might have the title of "Get In Touch With Us" instead of something more concise such as "Contact".

While this makes sense in the context of your content, it can make finding and editing the correct page or post in the admin panel annoying and time-consuming.

Admin Content Labels allows you to create an admin-specific labels for your content so that you'll always know what you're editing regardless of how it's titled on the front end. With this plugin, you can title your content however you like and still keep your admin panel neat, organized, and manageable.
